# Todo List

---

## Item 1: Change display order of statuses ✅ (merged PR #9)

Reordered status filter tabs in `index.html` to: All, Ordered, Shipped, Delivered, Replacement Ordered, Return Started, Return in Transit, Return Complete, Cancelled.

---

## Item 2: Fix "replacement ordered" items way past the deadline ✅ (merged PR #10)

Extended `effectiveStatus()` in `app.js` to demote "Replacement Ordered" items that are >30 days past their `return_window_end` to "Delivered", consistent with existing "Return Started" logic.

---

## Item 3: Add a "show graph" button with a stacked bar chart modal ✅ (merged PR #11)

Added a "Show Graph" button that opens a modal with a stacked bar chart (Chart.js via CDN) showing item counts per status per year across all data. Legend, tooltip, and bar stack all ordered Ordered→Cancelled.

--- 

## Item 4: Enable fast load ✅ (merged PR #16)

On first load, only the year files covering the last 3 months are fetched dynamically (at most 2 files). The header shows "X of Y items (load all)" where Y comes from a new `ORDER_DATA_YEAR_COUNTS` map written into the manifest by `fetch_orders.py`. Clicking "(load all)" fetches remaining years and switches the header to "Y items · Show Graph". The "Show Graph" button is hidden until all data is loaded.

---

## Item 5: Subscribe and Save ✅ (merged PR #17)

Added a `subscribe_and_save` boolean to each item record in `fetch_orders.py` (detected via `order.subscription_discount is not None`). Shows a ↻ badge on S&S item cards, and added a "↻ S&S only" checkbox filter to the right of the status tabs. The checkbox label shows a live count of S&S items in the currently active tab.

---

## Item 6: Return Policy

Figure out what you can determine about the return policy for a given item - I specifically want to know if it's "free returns", or if its a non-returnable item.  Show a small icon on the item card indicating each of these.

---

## Item 7: Monthly Graph ✅ (merged PR #18)

Replaced the "Show Graph" button with two icon buttons — `▐▐▐ Years` and `▐▐▐ Months` — each opening the same modal with a different aggregation. The Years chart is the existing annual stacked bar chart; Months shows a trailing-12-month stacked bar chart (current month included). Both buttons are hidden until all data is loaded (consistent with Item 4 fast-load behavior).

---

## Item 8: Automated Tests

It's time to add some automated tests to this project.  This is a bit tricky, since the data is my personal order history - which shouldn't be part of the tests.  So I think the right approach is to mock the Amazon APIs, have those return some synthetic orders, and then verify that everything works in a deterministic and correct way for those orders.  I want to verify both the fetching process and the web view.

---

## Item 9: Add data to Git

I want to also store my data files in git - but obviously in a private repo that's separate from the main public repo.  I think the right approach is to make it a submodule - can you set that up?

---

## Item 10: Diagnose "Return in Transit"

There are 73 items in "return in transit" status, most quite old.  This doesn't make sense - there should be essentially zero.  Are these items that I forgot to ship back?  Or did they get lost by the shipping company and never arrived at Amazon?  Or did Amazon receive them but didn't credit me for the return, for some reason?  Investigate this issue - look at some example items in that status from various years, use Chrome to find the tracking number and then access the tracking history, and write an analysis of what you've found.
